# CodeQL configuration for PostHog Rust SDK

# This configuration suppresses false positives that are expected behavior
# for an analytics SDK:
# - Project API keys are PUBLIC keys designed to be transmitted
# - Example code intentionally shows user IDs for demonstration purposes

  # The PostHog project API key (token) is a PUBLIC key, not a secret.
  # It's designed to be included in client-side code and transmitted to the API.
  # This is different from the personal API key which IS kept secret.
