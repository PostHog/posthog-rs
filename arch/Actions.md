# PostHog Actions API

**Core Concepts (from the list only):**

*   **`project_id`:**  A parameter present in all these endpoints, indicating the PostHog project.
*   **`id`:** Refers to a specific action's unique identifier.
*   **Actions:** The endpoints suggest the ability to retrieve, create, update, and delete "actions," but we don't know their precise nature from this list alone.

**Authentication (Inferred from previous knowledge, but applicable here):**

*   **Personal API Key:** Likely uses your *Personal* API Key.
*   **Authorization Header:** Likely requires `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY`.

**Endpoint Summary:**

1.  **`GET /api/projects/:project_id/actions/`**

    *   **Purpose:** (Based on standard RESTful conventions) Likely retrieves a list of actions within a project.
    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Base URL:** `https://[your-posthog-instance]/api/projects/:project_id/actions/`
    *   **Request Parameters:**
        *   `project_id`: The project ID.
    *   **Response Body:** (Speculation) Probably a JSON array of action objects.

2.  **`POST /api/projects/:project_id/actions/`**

    *   **Purpose:** (Based on standard RESTful conventions) Likely creates a new action within a project.
    *   **Method:** `POST`
    *   **Base URL:** `https://[your-posthog-instance]/api/projects/:project_id/actions/`
    *   **Request Parameters:**
        *   `project_id`: The project ID.
    *   **Request Body:** (Speculation) JSON data defining the new action.

3.  **`GET /api/projects/:project_id/actions/:id/`**

    *   **Purpose:** (Based on standard RESTful conventions) Likely retrieves a single action by its ID.
    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Base URL:** `https://[your-posthog-instance]/api/projects/:project_id/actions/:id/`
    *   **Request Parameters:**
        *   `project_id`: The project ID.
        *   `id`: The action's ID.
    *   **Response Body:** (Speculation) Probably a JSON object representing the action.

4.  **`PATCH /api/projects/:project_id/actions/:id/`**

    *   **Purpose:** (Based on standard RESTful conventions) Likely updates *part* of an existing action.
    *   **Method:** `PATCH`
    *   **Base URL:** `https://[your-posthog-instance]/api/projects/:project_id/actions/:id/`
    *   **Request Parameters:**
        *   `project_id`: The project ID.
        *   `id`: The action's ID.
    *   **Request Body:** (Speculation) JSON data with the fields to update.

5.  **`DELETE /api/projects/:project_id/actions/:id/`**

    *   **Purpose:** (Based on standard RESTful conventions) Likely deletes an action.
    *   **Method:** `DELETE`
    *   **Base URL:** `https://[your-posthog-instance]/api/projects/:project_id/actions/:id/`
    *   **Request Parameters:**
        *   `project_id`: The project ID.
        *   `id`: The action's ID.
    *   **Response Body:** (Speculation) Likely a success indicator (e.g., 204 No Content).

**Important Notes (and Limitations):**

*   This summary is *extremely* limited because the provided information is just a list of endpoints. I've used standard RESTful API conventions to *infer* the likely purpose of each endpoint, but *without further documentation, I cannot describe the request bodies, response formats, or specific behaviors*.
*   I am *assuming* standard authentication with a Personal API Key, but this *must* be confirmed in the full PostHog documentation.
*  It's crucial to consult Posthog documentation for all of the request and response details.

This is the best I can do with the provided information *only*. To provide a useful summary, I'd need the actual documentation describing the data structures and expected behaviors of each endpoint.
