# PostHog Sessions API

**Core Concepts (Inferred):**

*   **`project_id`**: The numerical ID of your PostHog project.
*   **Sessions**: These endpoints seem to provide information *about* user sessions (periods of activity), not the detailed recording data.
* **Authentication:** It is not specified how to authorize, but from previous knowledge we can assume it is similar to other endpoints.
*   **Base URL:** `https://[your-posthog-instance]/`

**Endpoint Summary:**

1.  **`GET /api/projects/:project_id/sessions/property_definitions/`**

    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Purpose:** (Inferred) Retrieves the *definitions* of properties that can be associated with *sessions*. This is about the *metadata* of session properties (names, data types), not the actual property values. This is likely analogous to the `property_definitions` endpoint for events and persons.
    *   **How to Call:**
        *   Replace `:project_id`.
        *   Example: `https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/123/sessions/property_definitions/`
        *   Include the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY` in header.
    *   **Response:** (Inferred) A list of property definition objects, each describing a session property (name, type, etc.).

2.  **`GET /api/projects/:project_id/sessions/values/`**

    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Purpose:** (Inferred) Retrieves the *unique values* for a given session property, across all sessions in the project. This is similar to the `events/values/` endpoint, but for session properties.
    *   **How to Call:**
        *   Replace `:project_id`.
        *   Query Parameters:
            *   `key`: (Required) The name of the session property you want values for.
        *   Example: `https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/123/sessions/values/?key=session_duration` (to get all unique session duration values)
        *   Include the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY` in header.
    *   **Response:** (Inferred) A list of unique values for the specified session property.

**Key Takeaways and Limitations:**

*   This Sessions API is very limited, with only two endpoints. It *doesn't* allow you to retrieve or manage individual sessions or session data directly.
*   It *does* provide information about session *properties*: their definitions (metadata) and unique values.
*   This API is likely used for exploring and understanding the *types* of data associated with sessions, not for analyzing the sessions themselves.
*   Always use your Personal API Key in the `Authorization` header.
*   The full documentation is needed.

This summary is based on very limited information (two `GET` endpoints). The actual PostHog API documentation for Sessions is *crucial* for understanding:

1.  How to actually retrieve session data (if possible via the API). These endpoints *don't* do that.
2.  The full context and intended use of session properties.

This response gives the best possible interpretation of the provided endpoints, but it's important to recognize its limitations due to the incompleteness of the information.
