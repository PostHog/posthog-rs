# PostHog Members API
**Core Concepts (from the URL and endpoints):**

*   **`organization_id`**: The numerical ID of your PostHog *organization*.
*   **`user__uuid`**:  The UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) of a *specific user* within the organization. This is how you identify individual members.
*   **Members**: These endpoints manage the existing members of an organization.
* **Authentication:** It is not specified how to authorize, but from previous knowledge we can assume it is similar to other endpoints.
*   **Base URL:** `https://[your-posthog-instance]/`

**Endpoint Summary:**

1.  **`GET /api/organizations/:organization_id/members/`**

    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Purpose:** Retrieves a list of all members of the specified organization.
    *   **How to Call:**
        *   Replace `:organization_id` with your organization's ID.
        *   Example: `https://app.posthog.com/api/organizations/123/members/`
        *   Include the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY` in header.
    *   **Response:** A JSON array of member objects. Each object likely includes:
        *   `user`: An object containing details about the user (including their `uuid`, `first_name`, `email`, etc.).
        *   `is_active`:  Boolean indicating if the member is currently active.
        *    `joined_at`: Timestamp of when the member joined.
        *   Other membership-related information (roles, permissions, etc.).

2.  **`PATCH /api/organizations/:organization_id/members/:user__uuid/`**

    *   **Method:** `PATCH`
    *   **Purpose:** Partially updates an existing member's information. This could be used to change their roles, permissions, or other attributes *within the organization*.  It's *not* for updating the user's core profile information (like their name or email).
    *   **How to Call:**
        *   Replace `:organization_id` and `:user__uuid`.
        *   Request Body (JSON): Contains *only* the fields you want to update (e.g., `is_active`, role assignments).
        *   Example: `https://app.posthog.com/api/organizations/123/members/abc-xyz-123/`
        *   Include the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY` in header.
         *  Set `Content-Type`: `application/json`
    *   **Response:** (Inferred) The updated member object.

3.  **`DELETE /api/organizations/:organization_id/members/:user__uuid/`**

    *   **Method:** `DELETE`
    *   **Purpose:** Removes a member from the organization. This likely revokes their access to the organization's projects and data.
    *   **How to Call:**
        *   Replace `:organization_id` and `:user__uuid`.
        *   Example: `https://app.posthog.com/api/organizations/123/members/abc-xyz-123/`
        *   Include the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY` in header.
    *   **Response:** 204 No Content (success).

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The Members API manages *existing* members of a PostHog *organization*.
*   You can list all members, update a member's organization-specific information (roles, etc.), and remove a member from the organization.
*   The `user__uuid` is the key identifier for individual members.
*   Always use your Personal API Key in the `Authorization` header.
