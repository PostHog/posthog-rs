# PostHog Environments API

**Core Concepts (Inferred):**

*   **`project_id`**: The numerical ID of the PostHog project.
*   **`id`**:  This has multiple potential meanings depending on the context:
    *   Under `/app_metrics/`, it refers to the ID of a *specific metric*.
    *   Under `/historical_exports/`, it refers to the ID of a *historical export*.
    *    Under `/backfills/`, it refers to the ID of a *Backfill*.
*   **`plugin_config_id`**: The ID of a Plugin Config, likely related to how app metrics are collected or processed.
*   **`batch_export_id`**:  The ID of a Batch Export configuration.
*   **App Metrics**: These endpoints seem to deal with retrieving metrics related to the performance and health of applications.
*   **Historical Exports**:  These appear to relate to exporting historical metric data.
*   **Batch Exports**:  This is the same concept as before â€“ continuous export of data.
*   **Environment:** Although the general name of this is environments, the naming conventions appear to be different.
* **Authentication:** It is not specified how to authorize, but from previous knowledge we can assume it is similar to other endpoints.
*   **Base URL:** `https://[your-posthog-instance]/`

**Endpoint Summary (Grouped by Resource):**

    *   **Response:** (Inferred) The requested historical export object.

**3. Batch Exports Endpoints:**

These endpoints seem to duplicate functionality from the previous Batch Exports API analysis, but within this "environments" context.  It's possible these are environment-specific batch exports.

*   **`GET /api/environments/:project_id/batch_exports/`**
     *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Purpose:** Lists Batch Export configurations.
    *   **How to Call:**

        *  Include the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY` in header.
    *   **Response:** A paginated list of Batch Export configuration objects.
*   **`POST /api/environments/:project_id/batch_exports/`**
     *   **Method:** `POST`
    *   **Purpose:** Creates Batch Export configurations.
    *   **How to Call:**
        *   Replace `:project_id` with your project's ID.
        *  Include the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY` in header.
*   **`GET /api/environments/:project_id/batch_exports/:batch_export_id/backfills/`**

    *   **Method:** `GET`

    *   **Response:** (Inferred) A list of Backfill objects.

*   **`POST /api/environments/:project_id/batch_exports/:batch_export_id/backfills/`**

    *   **Method:** `POST`
    *   **Purpose:** (Inferred) Creates a new Backfill for a Batch Export.
    *   **How to Call:** Replace `:project_id` and `:batch_export_id`. Request Body (JSON): (Inferred) Data defining the backfill (date range, etc.).
    *  Include the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY` in header.
    *   **Response:** (Inferred) The newly created Backfill object.

    *   **Response:** (Inferred) The updated Backfill object (with a cancelled status).

**Key Takeaways and Recommendations:**

*   This set of endpoints seems to combine functionalities related to app metrics, historical data exports, and batch exports, possibly within a project's environment context.
*   The Batch Export endpoints appear to duplicate functionality from the dedicated Batch Exports API, but might be scoped to the environment.
*   Always use your Personal API Key in the `Authorization` header, using `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY`.
*   Crucially, the *actual* PostHog API documentation for these endpoints is needed to confirm the exact purpose, request/response structures, and relationships between these resources. The provided list, combined with an incorrect URL, only allows for informed guesses. This summary is *highly speculative* due to the inconsistent and incomplete information.

This analysis is the best possible interpretation given the limited and mismatched information provided. It's *essential* to consult the correct, official PostHog API documentation for these endpoints to get accurate and complete details.
