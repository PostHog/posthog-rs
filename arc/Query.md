Below, I have outlined the PostHog Query API endpoint architecture based on the information provided:

### Overview

The Query API endpoint is the main interface for querying data in PostHog, supporting various types of queries, including trends, funnels, actors, events, and HogQL queries. It is versatile for querying both event data and non-event data, such as persons or session replay metadata. The endpoint imposes certain rate limits and result size restrictions.

### Endpoints Summary

1. **POST /api/projects/:project_id/query**
   - **Description**: Main endpoint for executing queries on PostHog data.
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Path**: `/api/projects/:project_id/query`
   - **Request Body**:
     - Must be a JSON object with a `query` field.
     - Example structure:
       ```json
       {
         "query": {
           "kind": "HogQLQuery",
           "query": "select properties.email from persons where properties.email is not null"
         }
       }
       ```
     - Optional parameters:
       - `async`: A client-provided ID for later reference.
       - `filters_override`: Specific filters to apply.
       - `refresh`: Defines query execution behavior concerning caching (e.g., 'blocking', 'async').
   - **Response**: Typically returns the query result, limited to 10,000 rows. JSON format.

2. **GET /api/projects/:project_id/query/:id**
   - **Description**: Retrieve the status or result of a previously executed query.
   - **Method**: GET
   - **Path**: `/api/projects/:project_id/query/:id`
   - **Response**:
     - JSON object containing fields such as `query_status`, `task_id`, and `results`.

3. **DELETE /api/projects/:project_id/query/:id**
   - **Description**: Cancel an ongoing query.
   - **Method**: DELETE
   - **Path**: `/api/projects/:project_id/query/:id`
   - **Response**: Status 204 No Content upon successful cancellation.

4. **POST /api/projects/:project_id/query/check_auth_for_async**
   - **Description**: Check authorization for executing asynchronous queries.
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Path**: `/api/projects/:project_id/query/check_auth_for_async`
   - **Response**: Status 200 with no body.

5. **GET /api/projects/:project_id/query/draft_sql**
   - **Description**: Retrieve draft SQL query for a project.
   - **Method**: GET
   - **Path**: `/api/projects/:project_id/query/draft_sql`
   - **Response**: Status 200 with no body.

### Important Considerations

- **Rate Limits**: The API allows up to 120 requests per hour per team, each capable of returning up to 10,000 rows.
- **Authentication**: Requires a personal API key with at least `query:read` scope.
- **Request Headers**: Should include 'Content-Type: application/json' and 'Authorization: Bearer [API_KEY]'.
- **Caching & Execution Modes**: The `refresh` parameter controls how queries interact with the cache and whether they execute asynchronously or synchronously.

### Known Issues

- Date filters may be overridden by default filters in HogQL unless explicitly set with `after` and `before`.
- If the query requires more data or requests than allowed by rate limits, consider using batch exports for larger data needs.

Before implementing the API client, ensure to handle possible API rate limits and request Payload errors gracefully, and maintain up-to-date API keys and scopes.
